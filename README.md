# cosmogenesis

Cosmogenesis is a project to develop a star system and planet generator. The generator will (eventually):

(1) read in stellar data, read in partial stellar data and fill in plausible values for what is missing, or generate a random set of physically plausible data according to a user's specifications;

(2) read in astronomical data on known exoplanets or read in a user-supplied list of fictional exoplanets;

(3) accept a user's choice of values
	(a) for planetological parameters that a not precisely known,
	(b) for implausible values of physical parameters to produce unrealistic but "gamable" universes;
	
(4) generate values to describe planets orbiting the stars and their moons; and

(5) store the results in a database.
